No complaints here. Price point is higher but I feel like this phone will last me for a long time.\",\n",
       " \"Initial impressions/rant +Tldr tier rating at the end.\\n\\nAfter using this phone for a week I love it! I got this phone on prime day with 128gb storage and 8gb ram for only $850 bucks!!! I've upgraded to this phone from a A52 4g ($400 dollar 2021 Samsung midrange phone) so that the reference phone. Here is a list of pros and cons, im going to start with the pros:\\n\\n-This camera is soo good, video is good (not as good as on the iPhone 13 series but definitely more than usable). I really do like the 3x, and 10x optical zoom and although the 100x space zoom is kind of a gimmick its still very cool and pictures are usable in 30x zoom! Macro mode is cool and front camera is also really good.\\n\\n-The screen is nice and bright, it's big and sharp and although some people don't really like curved screens I don't really mind it that much. Also the Adaptable 1hz-120hz is a game changer and depending on your usage it can actually help you save battery life!\\n\\n-The S-Pen functionality is great, it sits on the bottom left of the phone. It now has a nice matte finish which makes it move less in your hands and allows you to be more precise. But its not as colorful as before. The way the S-Pen feels and functions makes me want to use it more for things like photos, videos, screenshots, and writing since the latency is 2.8 milliseconds which is barley noticeable and if you don't want to use it just put it away since it's part of the phone.\\n\\n-The charging is pretty fast (goes up to 45w) I use the 25w fast charger and can get this phone to 100% in around an hour. For wireless charging it charges at 15w max and for reverse wireless charging or powershare (surprised Apple hasn't introduced this feature yet) it charges other devices at 5w which may seem little but the way I think it's intended to be used or the way I use it is to charge accessories like my watch and buds to last me the day.\\n\\n-The speakers are good and loud. It's a dual speaker set-up with the top one being the earpiece and other one being on the bottom left of the phone. The only thing I dont like about them is the placement of the bottom speaker because when you turn your phone over to the left (most people do and it's so the camera is on the top left of the phone in landscape rather than the bottom right) your right hand either cups or covers the bottom facing speaker. Another pro is that both speakers have those little white foam ball's in them which makes them sound louder without losing detail which is good.\\n\\n-The build quality on this phone is A+ it feels so nice in the hands and the curves make it pretty good to hold. The corners are sharp but a case should do just fine. And the back glass is so nice and it feels great, it also doesn't leave fingerprints!\\n\\n-The Design is subjective so this is all my opinion and I would say that I like it. Although the no camera bump is wierd since I'm used to the camera bumbs and I really liked the one on the S21 Ultra this is better because it's just one thing less sticking out the back of the phone. It also makes the slim cases for this phone even slimmer since they don't have to compensate for the camera bump. One think to note is that since now it's just separate cameras sticking out there is less protection because there is no more metal housing around them and the camera gets pretty dusty around the lenses so you just have to pay a bit more attention but still imo a better design.\\n\\n-The color is again Subjective and I got it in green and im going to tell you guys, this is the color to get if you don't want Burgundy. I think this color is better but the top 2 most popular colors is this one and that one. Another thing is that while you can see the pictures of this phone which I've taken on the A52 4g the picture doesn't do it justice, this green is epic! It's like the green that the iPhone 13 series has but to me it looks like a aquamarine color (blue green) with a little more green into it so in some lightning it can look a bit blue but it would mostly look more green. Great color though!\\n\\nNow here we go to the downsides which is only one: The battery life (Sorry for the rant in advance)\\n\\n-The only downside in my opinion to this phone is the battery life, this phone with a 5,000mlh battery allows me to only get about 4 to 5 hrs of SOT out of the box??? Come on Samsung, for $1,199 this battery is unacceptable. The iPhone 13 pro max gets up to 9 hours of SOT for $100 less and with a faster processor. I really hope that a future update comes that drastically fixes the battery because this is not it. I did watch a few dozen videos that give tips on what settings to turn on/off to give me the best battery life without losing things like a QHD+ 120hz screen or turning on battery saver because I paid for it so I should be able to experience this phone at its fullest potential and I've been able to get this phone up to a solid 7 hours of SOT which is definitely an improvement but Samsung we shouldn't need to be doing this for $1,199. I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 because otherwise this phone is Awesome and I was able to increase the battery life about 2 to 3 hours more without sacrificing things like screen resolution and refresh rate or processor speed.\\n\\nI do plan of keeping this phone because other than the battery, it's great in every other category. I also got it for a steal and with how good Samsungs trade in credit is I'm going to take good care of it until the S23 ultra comes out (Hopefully with a battery improvement) and ill trade in this phone to get that one for about $200 bucks. I love Samsung and am in the Samsung ecosystem pretty deep (galaxy watch 4 44mm in green and galaxy buds+ black) but there are just some things that I can't tolerate but hopefully they see what the problem is (most likely is some software problem) and they fix it by giving this phone a software update or make a hardware change on the next phone that comes out. I do appreciate the 4 years of OS updates I really do but there is no way I can use a phone for 4 years that has a mediocre battery experience. But so far this phone is great in every other way and I'll update when things change and if the battery life gets better. But so far it's a easy 8/10 for me, good work Samsung!\\n\\nTldr: Phone rating: (Compared to iPhone and other Andrioid flagship phones + my subjective opinion)\\n\\n-Camera: A+ Tier\\n-Screen: S Tier\\n-S-Pen: A+ Tier (compared to the ones before on the Note series)\\n-Charging: A Tier\\n-Speakers: A+ Tier\\n-Build Quality: S Tier\\n-Design: A+ (Subjective)\\n-Color: A+ (Subjective)\\n-Battery: B- (Goes to B+ if you optimize the phone enough)\",\n",
       " 'Great phone with some flaws. But first things first...this is a well designed, very functional, high performance phone. The cameras are possibly the best you\\'ll get on a phone for now. Better than those on the Iphone 13(which maybe deals with low light situations better). The wide angle options both for stills (see night mode pics \"regular\\'and wide angle) videos are especially great. Zoom is well executed and integrated, although I\\'ve never used the 100x. Overall pic. quality is absolutely top notch(for a phone in 2022). The stylus feels smoother than previous versions, and the matt surface helps with grip. The existence of a stylus alone puts this phone in a league of its own. Charging is quick, especially for such a \\'heavy duty\\' phone.\\nThe large size of the screen is really a plus if you\\'re multitasking and have several screens open. It\\'s easier to toggle between screens. There\\'s several minor improvements that add up to a much better user experience. The screen that pops up when the Spen is pulled out for e.g.\\n\\nThings not to love: The absence of a microSD slot still bugs me. The phone is heavy. Not a fan of the speakers. The price(although I got it at a discount to the launch price).\\n\\nOverall, the phone is very definitely worth the large investment its purchase entails. In the functionality vs portability vs price tradeoff the S22 Ultra more than any other phone hits a sweet spot.',\n",
       " \"This is the best Android phone that I've ever owned. Cameras are awesome. Pictures are crystal clear and the response time is amazing! The only reason that I gave it 4 stars was because the screen cracked after it accidentally dropped, but it was less than half a foot and I had the case on it. Their advertising of the Gorilla Glass Invictus is misleading. It is only made to prevent scratches on the screen, so I suggest you invest in an expensive, sturdy phone case and screen protector. It's gonna cost me about a quarter of what I paid for the phone to get it repaired and not anyone can do it because of the special curved glass it uses.\",\n",

Rear camera bump is alot,get a case on it asap.\\n\\nHeating problem still there but nothing a couple updates cant fix. Still a bit of a dissapointment from the best that samsung offers.\\n\\nIf you're 2 gens behind at least, then I can recommend the upgrade. Other than that probs wait for next ultra.\",\n",
       " \"There's not much to write honestly - all the essential ingredients for an amazing phone is put together in a wonderfully designed package. Battery Life A+, Screen A+, Camera A+, Speed A+ - I guess the only thing I would like to highlight is that the size of the phone is quite big and this is coming from an ex iPhone 13 Pro Max user.\",\n",
       " 'So I really like the idea of android, but unfortunately that’s where it stops. I have owned 90% of every Samsung galaxy phone ever made but unfortunately they are all plagued by the horrible android experience. What is that you may say? Within days of usage the phone in all its power packed, high priced glory, starts to lag. I purchased the S22 ultra in hopes that things were finally fixed, but no, the same experience as every other Samsung and Android device I’ve ever used. Now I will tell you there are a few good things about the phone so I will briefly list the pros and cons:\\n\\nPro - beautiful screen that is definitely fluid, but only after you go in and close all of the open apps. I don’t pay over a thousand dollars to have poor memory management, bottom line.\\n\\nThe battery life is decent, and the fast charging is excellent.\\n\\nUnfortunately that’s where my list of pros ends.\\n\\nCons - as stated before, due to it being an Android OS, the memory management is horrible causing constant lag not worthy of such a high priced device.\\n\\nThe screen gets scratched up to easily. And before you say, well put a screen protector on it, I tried, spent $50 on a screen protector which rendered the fingerprint scanner all but useless, removed and trashed it same day.\\n\\nFingerprint scanner and facial recognition - sorry but they both suck. I found myself having to enter my passcode 90% of the time because the facial recognition is not actual facial recognition such as that in the IPhone which works flawlessly. The fingerprint scanner which is under the screen, lets just say it’s a joke and I truly don’t care if Apple ever implements it because it’s underwhelming.\\n\\nI am writing this review from my iPhone 13 pro max which is far superior to the S22 ultra. I never close apps on it and guess what, it doesn’t lag on me. When I unlock it it begins doing what I want it to do without hesitation. And I know that all of the Fandroids out there will say, well iOS doesn’t utilize true background apps and when you go to the home page on the phone they aren’t really still open in the background and to that I say, Greattt, my phone doesn’t lag and when I do go back to one of those “not open apps”, guess what, it opens right up for me and the S22 is still lagging and saying to itself “please clear my memory!!!!”.\\n\\nAnd lastly, this is not a paid review, I got nothing for free nor do I get compensation for voicing my experiences with either phone or operating system. I’m just sick and tired of giving second chances to Android phones just to be let down over and over again.',\n",

       " 'I am a fan of the Note series. I was also deeply disappointed when they announced that they were discontinuing it. It was so crazy popular, it seemed like a decision that couldn\\'t possibly be based on 𝙖𝙣𝙮 amount of actual research whatsoever. After their announcement we saw the scramble by Samsung to figure out a way to save face while still appealing to those same fans. Their answer: the S21 Ultra, which would have all the same features of a Note, but not come with the S-Pen built-in...and the one you could purchase, was (at the beginning) $40...plus it did not come bluetooth enabled...and you had to purchase a special case in order to hold the pen if you actually planned on using it.\\n\\nI was torn. I had a Note 9 and loved it, and wanted what I 𝙩𝙝𝙤𝙪𝙜𝙝𝙩 was going to be the Note 22 Ultra which, of course, never materialized. But, since it had pretty much all the features of a Note, I went ahead and got one. It was a GIANT upgrade over my Note 9. HUGE, in fact. The performance was incredibly improved. I loved that phone. And then something weird happened to me last week. While I was biking to work at 4:15am, it fell out of my pocket (my own stupid fault) and no matter how hard I tried, I could not find it. My beloved S21 was gone forever. I chose to replace it with the S22 Ultra - which, I would like to point out, I did NOT intend to purchase, but since I needed a new device and it was available with a decent deal, I ordered one.\\n\\nFirst off, the design is...interesting. It has grown on me I must admit. Initially I much preferred the S21 style overall (and I think I still do)...but as I said, it is growing on me. I chose green because I hadn\\'t ever had a phone in that color before and figured, why not? If I\\'m being honest, I prefer the rounded corners of the S series to the more boxy, straight corners of the Note line - which, let\\'s be honest, this is. The styling is exactly like a Note and totally different from the other \"lesser\" versions of the S22 series. Since I was given an iPhone as a work phone, I have come around to kind of preferring a flat screen to the waterfall curved edges that Samsung initially pioneered (with I believe the S6 Edge). It was a cool design, no doubt, but finding a screen protector that also works with the fingerprint reader (that doesn\\'t also have a circle you can SEE built-into the glass) is mighty difficult. I\\'ve bought 3 different brands and none of them worked with the fingerprint reader and folks, that sucked. I truly believe in a screen protector and I will NOT use a silicone version. It has to be glass, that is what mimics the feel and touch of a real screen in the first place and no silicone can pull that off (that I have ever heard of anyway). I imagine getting a glass protector for my S22 may prove to be equally as difficult. We shall see, I haven\\'t tried that as yet. After doing some research, I expected the camera bump on the back to be more of an issue if I placed my phone on it\\'s back. Being un-even meant it would tilt and rock back and forth...I say expected because almost all the reviews I had read brought this fact up. Never mind that it was even more pronounced on the S21 series, but I have to say, in my experience, it has been far less of an issue than I had been expecting. In fact, it hardly tilts at all. In my opinion, this is a non-issue.\\n\\nThe loud speakers I expected are another thing I \"thought\" I was going to get but was wrong about. Honestly, I felt my S21 had louder speakers overall. I did a video chat with someone last night and I was quite surprised how low the volume was, even while on maximum. Another mark against the S22 I\\'m afraid. Not a huge one, but one worth noting.\\n\\nPerformance-wise, I can\\'t really see an improvement here over the S21, which was already pretty good. I have watched a few S21 vs S22 speed tests on YouTube and was a bit surprised when the S21 actually was quicker at booting up and opening several apps than the supposedly faster chipset with the S22. So overall, I have seen no genuine or clear improvements in that area, and that\\'s a little disappointing.\\n\\nThe screen doesn\\'t seem to be noticeably better, either. This is subjective, so keep that in mind. Samsung arguably makes the best screens on mobile devices so it is getting harder and harder to see improvements, which is understandable. It does get brighter however, which is nice. Let\\'s just say the screen continues to be exceptional and move on.\\n\\nThere are a few new customization tweaks that are nice, but in no way justify upgrading your phone for. New ways to add color to your icons with the color palette is nice, but not exactly something I\\'d be willing to shill out the cost of a phone in order to utilize. New ways to customize callers backgrounds, even add a custom video to a specific caller so at a glance, you can know for sure who it is - but then again, if you have the contact saved to your phone, won\\'t you already know that because you can see their name and photo come up if they do call? This is kind of redundant, but I have to say, it IS a nice way to further customize your device that iPhones cannot even remotely touch.\\n\\nThere are a few new things the S-Pen can do that previous versions couldn\\'t - at least that\\'s what I THINK, I am not 100% certain since my previous S-Pen did not have bluetooth capability...and I am not sure if that means they are exclusive to the S22 and will not be available to earlier versions with updates or not, but since my previous pen was not bluetooth at all, it\\'s nice to see. There are all kinds of new gestures that can turn up volume or down using the S-Pen, also switching from rear camera to front when double pressing the button, swiping to the left and right will take you to different screens, it\\'s all fairly cool and for the most part, intuitive, which is great. Oh also, the latency when writing on the screen has been cut in half - and it was already quite good, so now, it really 𝙙𝙤𝙚𝙨 feel like you\\'re actually writing with a pen on the screen. Wow, in this area things have significantly improved.\\n\\nThe cameras aren\\'t a big step-up. The S21 already had great cameras that were significantly better than the Note 20, but here the camera improvements are marginal - at best. Which isn\\'t to say they aren\\'t great, but just not a very big difference. The Night Vision Camera mode (which Samsung is calling \"nightography\" or something similarly absurd) is better, I have to admit. It can make twilight photography look virtually like bright daylight. This may turn off some people who wants a darker tone to help illustrate the time of day the photo was taken, which you can still do if you want, but you just may have to tweak the settings a tad first, so keep that in mind. I find ANY phone that can shoot video in 8K to be a crazy waste of internal memory. If you don\\'t have a screen that will even display that, what\\'s the point? Also, it only records at 24 FPS which is inferior to 30 FPS. ANY phone that cannot display your video in 8K, I say, what\\'s the point? 4K is fantastic, so buying a phone based on that is a waste of money and the video it DOES take simply isn\\'t very good to begin with at 24 FPS (watch a video on the difference and you\\'ll know what I\\'m talking about). But overall, a stellar camera set up - it just isn\\'t 𝙩𝙝𝙖𝙩 much better than the S21 to be the reason for buying a new phone.\\n\\n45 watt charging...wow, nice feature...but not including a brick? PETTY and greedy on Samsung\\'s part. This is simple greed and taking a page DIRECTLY out of apple\\'s playbook - which, if you\\'ll remember, Samsung bitterly mocked the first time they did not include a charging brick...only to do the exact same thing the very next year and swept it under the rug like it never happened. They argue that less packaging and less product helps save the environment...but if you want to take advantage of 45 w charging, you MUST go out and purchase a whole new brick, which is more packaging and product which overall, is WORSE for the environment than had you included one in the first place. It\\'s a cash grab, pure and simple and this is one area where stealing from apple only makes you look much worse in my opinion. Your opinion may vary.\\n\\nBattery life...? This is a bit of a sore spot for me. With every new phone model, year after year, either thru optimization, newer, more efficient chipsets or bigger batteries, you generally have come to expect better, longer battery life from phones. This is the first year I can recall where that just did not happen and I\\'m at a loss to understand why. I\\'m frustrated, and if I\\'m being honest, more than a little upset that this is one area where Samsung chose not to improve upon...and let\\'s be honest, battery life is one area almost everyone agrees is what really ought to get better with every new iteration of a new device. Is it significantly worse? No. But it certainly isn\\'t even AS good as my S21 was after I had used it for close to 18 months. Just slightly less...but I\\'m sorry, that is a GINORMOUS negative for me, and ought to be for everyone. There simply is no excuse when every other company that manufactures phones manages to do it. My iPhone 13 is ridiculously better battery life than even my S21 did right out of the box. Like 20-30% by my estimation. Let me give you an example. On my bedside table I will top off my battery before bed, and unplug it and use it for my alarm. By the time it goes off, my S21 would be roughly around 91 - 93% after all night sitting there. I top off my iPhone 13 before bed, and wake up with it at.....100% still. I\\'ve never owned a phone that came close to that. And, my S22 is close to 89 - 90% under the exact same circumstances. Granted, the iPhone does not employ an always-on display, but I tried the same thing with that turned off and it helped reduce my battery consumption by a whopping 1%. Wow, big deal. This is one area that apple has finally surpassed android, and they did so dramatically. Samsung should be embarrassed.\\n\\nI am also still upset that my Galaxy Watch 4 is such a total POS. I turn it on and it is essentially useless for close to ten full minutes. The stuttering, glitching, re-starts, apps occasionally not opening or taking an absurd amount of time to open tells me that switching back to Wear OS was an astonishingly bad move. Tizen was FAR superior. Sure, it didn\\'t have a huge app selection, but what it DID do was something I cannot say for Wear OS: It was stable. Like all the time. It just WORKED. Wear OS? Not so much. Oh, and before you get upset at me for dissing Wear OS, I\\'m not alone. The internet is LITTERED with people who have had the exact same experience as me with the Watch 4. I WANTED (desperately) to like the watch. I wanted this new version of Wear OS to do what previous versions couldn\\'t. I\\'d LIKE to say it does, but I can\\'t, because in my personal experience, the OS simply has failed to operate as promised.\\n\\nEither way, I am 𝙢𝙤𝙨𝙩𝙡𝙮 satisfied with my S22 Ultra. It definitely isn\\'t perfect by any stretch, but it IS better in more areas than not compared to the S21.\\n\\n***UPDATE***\\n\\nI cannot stress enough the need to put a case on this. No matter HOW nice it looks, the dang thing is crazy slick and can slip out of your hand incredibly easy. Seriously guys. BE CAREFUL.\\n\\n***UPDATE #2***\\n\\nThe longer I own the S22, the slightly more disappointed I am. The performance has been quite a shocking revelation to me. No previous flagship I have ever owned has had the stuttering, and glitches that I\\'ve found with this device. To say I\\'m just flat-out surprised is an understatement. This has never happened before - not like this at least. App\\'s take far longer to open then with my S21 Ultra. Now why would that be on a newer, supposedly more powerful device? It doesn\\'t make sense. It is almost (but not quite) as bad as how poorly my Galaxy Watch 4 was in comparison to my Watch 3 (I cannot begin to describe how much better Tizen was (performance-wise) than Wear OS has been). I\\'m hoping this will all be cleared up in a future update.\\n\\nThe slick coating of the device continues to be a ROYAL pain. I have dropped this phone more in the last 4 days than probably all my previous phones 𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙗𝙞𝙣𝙚𝙙. Yes, I have ordered a case, but it seems to be taking a crazy long time to arrive, which is annoying but it\\'s beyond my control. I simply cannot impress upon you enough how important one is for this because it isn\\'t a question of if you\\'ll drop it, but when. Overall, I have simply been underwhelmed with how astonishingly minor the upgrade seems to be in comparison to the S21 Ultra (which I LOVED). Performance-wise it has been a downgrade and don\\'t get me started on how disappointing the battery life has been. Especially compared with my iPhone 13, which has crazy good battery life. C\\'mon Samsung, what happened??\\n\\n***FINAL UPDATE***\\n\\nAfter a little over a week I find myself regretting buying the S22 Ultra. For one, Samsung needs to stop calling it that and just call it what it is: A Note. It looks vastly different from the other phones in the S22 lineup and that alone distinguishes it as something different altogether. Each new day seems to bring me more things which ultimately makes me wish I had gone with the Flip 3 or waited for the Flip 4, or just bought a new S21 Ultra again. That phone was just about my all-time favorite. Superior in virtually every way I can think of. Sure, there are a few incredibly minor tweaks which (on paper) makes the S22 better, but is it enough to take notice that you reportedly have a newer device that is supposed to be better? The answer to that is a flat-out NO. Camera improvements are (for me) impossible to tell any difference. Performance-wise, my S21 was superior and had very few glitches. I\\'m sure most - if not all - of the software problems I seem to encounter daily can and probably will be fixed with an upcoming update, but to release a phone with THIS many issues right out of the gate? Inexcusable. Especially for what we\\'re paying. I have come to realize that if anyone wants my opinion, I will be up front and tell them to buy something else...and I take no joy in saying this, especially as a long-time Samsung fan. Samsung has copied so many things from apple that they used to mock them for it has made them kind of like that insufferable bully at school who made fun of so many other people for dozens of things that they ended up doing themselves. It\\'s childish and absurd, really. At this point, Samsung has practically pushed me into the arms of apple - and TRUST me, a year ago that isn\\'t something I believe I would be even capable of saying. Just save your money, or get something else.',\n",

       " \"Overall the hardware of the phone is fine. It does what it is supposed to do....except the installed software apps are not very good. Whe doesn't Samsung just transfer the apps I was using on my own phone. Instead of transferring the most common google apps and the defaults I had, Samsung replaces those apps with it's own inferior apps. Samsung has it's own message app, contact, app, security app, voice app, keyboard app, etc. All of those apps seem buggy and fail to work then the more robust google apps I was using. I tried to delete and replace Sampsungs apps with the apps I like better but have not figured out how to get rid of the crappy preinstalled apps. Frequently I have to reboot my phone because Samsungs key board app doesn't work. It is aggravating when I need to type something but Samsung's keyboard doesn't come up no matter how many times I tap on a text fields. The photo app is hard to find my photos. The voice app does a poor job of recognizing my voice. If Samsung just let me use my previous apps instead of trying to force me to use their inferior apps, I would be more satisfied. It makes me wonder why Samsung wants to force me to use their inferior apps. Is there some ulterior reason Samsung wants to control the most commonly used apps on my phone? I had the Pixel Pro 6 before getting this phone. The software on the Pixel 6 Pro phone worked great but I had to return it because googles hardware had problems they needed to work out. I wish Samsung had been as seamless to transfer to with the power and ease of the Pixel phone but find I miss how well that google Pixel Pro 6 software was. Samsung has decent hardware and crappy software. If they just transferred my setting and apps I had I would not have to waste so many hours trying to undo and change the crappy apps that Samsung is trying to force me to use. To give you an example of the differences on Pixel 6 Pro, I could type any word into the photos app and the AI software would find related pictures. On Samsung, it finds nothing and it won't even find folders labeled with the search word. I miss the AI features of google Pixel 6 Pro and feel Samsung really needs to improve their software or use the better apps that google provides. For a phone that costs over $1000 I can't tell much difference from a phone that cost $300 other than the phone has more memory and is slightly faster when it works and doesn't force me to reboot because the apps are not working. Not sure why this phone is so over priced and comes with software that is so poorly made and often fails to perform basic tasks the apps are supposed to do.\",\n",
       " \"I got my phone early from Samsung directly and It's everything I needed as a heavy 'Note' user for the last 8 years. To me the S-Pen and the feature set of the Note line up along with flagship specs and customizability has been the main draw (pun intended). There's not a better oled screen on a phone out there, the battery life lasts me all day with 6-7 hours of heavy screen on time watching 4K HDR Netflix and Youtube, gaming, digital painting, taking and editing photos, etc. It's definitely a niche group of people who make full use of a phone like this, especially the S-Pen features and toolsets, but if that's you then go for it. The only negative thing I'll say is that there is no Micro-SD slot this time around. If you want a large Note style phone with expandable storage, I suggest buying the Note 20 Ultra. That phone is still incredible almost 2 years later and will definitely satisfy most people's needs for a while longer.\",\n",

Google Maps always thought I was trying to SWING the map around. The S Pen remote photo button never worked for me for the rear nor front camera. I watched YouTube videos about it. I went into settings. Yes, it's selected correctly. I made sure I had most up-to-date OS. Rebooted the phone. I still can't take a photo remotely using the S Pen. Close distance nor far.

It's just not any different from the Note 20 which came out TWO years ago!! It feels and functions the same in a day to day basis.\\nI also feel like 5 cameras are just too much to put on the back, it looks ugly and they don't make any difference for a casual photographer!\\nQuick points of comparison if you were ever debating between both phones :\\nScreen: both screens are amazing, obviously a bigger screen on the S22 ultra gives more room for watching or scrolling through your phone.\\nCameras : Honestly the pixel 6 pro seems to have a much better camera software. Photos seem to look better with the Pixel's camera without tweaking the shot while with Samsung you had to know exactly what to select to get a proper shot. The selfie l/front camera on Samsung still gives that washed out, not true, picture vs the Pixel's more natural look. Both are not great in low light situations, though night mode is a little better on the Pixel.\\nSoftware: The pure Android experience on Pixel is unmatched! The phone is much cleaner and feels more efficient. With Samsung One UI skin, you get tons of useless things to do the same job! Everything is big and the side tray interferes with the Android 12 back gesture, you want to open a page there are 5 apps that can be used for it.\\nIt just feels cluttered and less appealing.\\nSize: The pixel 6 pro, for me, feels like the perfect dimension, but thatay go down to each one's opinion. However the weight is just too much for the S22 ultra, it's also VERY slippery,that's basically unusable without a case.\\nGoing back to the pixel after many days with the S22 ultra just feels right and being more than $400 cheaper makes it a better deal as well.\\nBattery: both have less than average batteries, which was a little disappointing, given that most of my other Samsung phones had pretty good battery life,, but not this one, you definitely can't have a full day of average use with full specs on this one unfortunately.\\nDon't get me wrong, the S22 Ultra ia a very good phone, it's just not that much better than the 2 year old note 20,the curved screen feels a bit outdated, and it's much more annoying to use, and the camera software still isn't great.\",\n",

       " \"First off let me say I'm not a fan of upgrading phones. I believe I stated that during my galaxy buds pro review... so I was pleasantly surprised with this phone. This review should be lengthy but will explain the good, the bad and what's included and if it's for you or not.\\n\\nLet's start off with the pros\\n- fingerprint reader on screen (works nearly flawlessly)\\n-facial recognition\\n- seemless Bluetooth\\n-long battery life\\n-power share\\n- newly engaged ecosystem (kinda like apple)\\n- great camera (pics in review are not even the pro modes)\\n- sPen\\n- decently loud phone\\n- customizable\\n-RAM+\\n-swipe mode (like an modern iPhone)\\n-DeX\\n- many other things I haven't touched upon yet.\\n\\nCons\\n- no aux port\\n- no SD card\\n- no power brick, or wired ear buds included\\n-default samsung keyboard\\n\\nThe packaging is nice and has a nice feeling opening it up. The transfer from my note 8 (which I loved if it wasn't for the battery expanding I would have kept it) but the s22 ultra made it simple. There's 4 versions but only 1 has different specs than the others.\\n-128 GB version has 8GB RAM\\n-256,512, and 1TB versions have 12 GB of ram\\nAll phones have an ability to increase processing speed, and they also have RAM+ features which allows you to use some storage space to convert it into virtual RAM allowing more apps to be used and more fluid use. It defaults at 4GB but can go down to 2GB or as high as 6 or 8GB of additional virtual RAM.\\n\\nAfter the initial set up and running though the features I noticed it's very fast and fluid and has a beautiful Amoled screen. There's 3 modes to the screen 1080HD, 2K, and 4k screen modes. I have it in the middle to conserve battery.\\n\\nThe Bluetooth is seemless. I thought it was special with the galaxy buds just instantly pairing but I literally turned on my crusher headset and boom they were on simple. The galaxy buds have amazing features which you can see my review on them.\\n\\nThe battery has lasted me the whole day and I have never went below 40% even with extensive use of the phone. Even today I was drawing on the phone with the spen and you can see a simple little drawing I did in the pics that was done on my phone with the spen. It didn't go below 50% on top of power saving mods, adaptive brightness, and dim mode the phone also has a way of learning how you use your phone and with what you do on it, it'll adjust to how you use it to conserve even more battery.\\n\\nThe camera is the last thing I care about but as I got this phone my mother got the newest iPhone so I had to set it up for her. My phone had less issues setting up phones and programs and hers was complicated and I can explain that simply. I am by no means an apple person, I do own an iPad but to be honest I hate the company,but i can't deny they make decent products. My mom went from an iPhone 8 to the newest pro max. I went to visit with my parents and we sat on the deck and I zoomed into the moon. 100x zoom on this phone makes astronomy pics amazing. Unfortunately the iPhone only had a 15x zoom and couldn't take a picture as clear as mine, which was strange to me because I always felt samsung have more noise and pixelization in the photos but s22 ultra took this win.\\n\\nThe ecosystem\\nECOSYSTEM\\nThis was always the big selling point to apple users. Why?because all their devices sync seamlessly. Calls, texts, pictures, Bluetooth, iPad, all their devices would work together nicely. So samsung has been working with windows and now we have a link to windows option which gives you all the features that apple has to your pc, and with any samsung device they work nearly seamlessly like the apple products. In fact if you have a galaxy s8 tablet, you can use your s22 ultra with it and if you're drawing the phone can become the tools while you can use the entire screen for drawing, it's great for artists. So samsung is catching up to apple, I'll still give apple the best ecosystem but with windows link they're catching up.\\n\\nDex allows you to use samsung on your pc via wired connection or Bluetooth. It creates an operating system similar to windows. This also works on the tablet which is nice. It's not a big substitute for a laptop but it's a good step to have the feature. It also allows you to back up things very simply by click, drag and drop onto your pc. The tablet works with windows and can become a 2nd monitor too!\\n\\nSo now I'm getting carried away but the ecosystem is amazing I was very impressed to see how much they're catching up. They have am easy mode for people who get confused, they have an iPhone swipe option if you dislike the buttons on android.\\n\\nNow for a $1200 phone you'd think... hey I should get SD card slot, an aux port or even USB c linked earbuds or a frigging power brick. Nope.\\n\\n-phone\\n- spen\\n-usbc to usbc cord. Is all that's included.\\n\\nThat said the features outweigh what's been lost in the phone. The spen has amazing features with the ability to use the camera and snap it. As well as Bixby and Google assistant to help with anything you need. Powershare is cool too, especially if you need to charge someone's phone or your earbuds.\\n\\nSo now the $1200 question... is it worth it? Honestly I got a deal on mine. Trading in my note 8 gave me $800 off the phone. So for me it was easy yes. But if you're an apple fan... I think it would be a welcomed change for anyone tired and wanting to try something new. Honestly I am sick of apples and samsungs practices of removing stuff from their phones, however playing with both models I don't notice much of a difference between the iPhone vs the Samsung s22 vs the note 8 has a dramatic change and lots of new options to cater to apple users.\\n\\nIf you're one of those people who have everything apple then you're better off sticking with Apple. From my experience if you're fully an apple person then you're getting the full experience of apple products but for an apple person with windows pc, samsung televisions, it's just a better suited phone to get the most out of your devices and as a smart phone itself it suits everything I needed.\\n\\nIt's perfect for my graphic arts, for studying, multitasking, music, movies, and if I want some photography, video editing and nightography and being creative on the go. I would never stray from samsung notes or this.\",\n",
       " 'The phone is great\\nJust wish battery could last longer.\\nI do use it heavily.\\nThe s20 ultra had a better display.\\nNot worth the upgrade if your coming from the s20 ultra but a great upgrade if your coming from iphone.',\n",
       " \"Let me just say that the S22 Ultra is a beast of a phone. However, there are certain things preventing me from being able to recommend it to some. Primarily there are two things; battery life and shutter lag. The battery life on this phone is not great. In my use case I am lucky to get between 5 and 6 hours of screen on time. This isn't terrible, but it's also not good. Somehow the older S21 Ultra maintained better battery life. Second, shutter lag has been an issue with Samsung phones for years now, unless the subject is perfectly still it tends to come out blurry. Now for the good stuff:\\n1. The utility of this camera system is unparalleled; having a 10x optical zoom is something that will spoil you.\\n2. The S pen offers great multitasking tools\\n3. The screen is gorgeous and huge, although I could personally do without the curved edges.\\n4. Sound quality for the speakers is also good, it gets loud enough for me and doesn't distort at max volume\\n5. If you own a windows computer, Samsung's integrated experience has gotten so much better in the last few years ( text messages, using your phone virtually, calls, etc..)\\n6. The under screen fingerprint scanner is lightning fast\\n7. Samsung Dex allows you to have a desktop environment using only your s22 ultra and an external display. It also allows you to connect wirelessly.\\n\\nFor me, battery life is the deal breaker here. For $1200 there should be no compromises. However, if you can look past the battery and the shutter issues you will not be disappointed.\",\n",
       " \"For a phone that costs as much as this one does, it sure doesn't include a lot. I'll start off with the negatives, then the positives. But be warned there are a lot of negatives.\\n\\nFor $1200 USD, there's no charger in the box, no headphones, no S-pen removal tips. There is no expandable storage via microSD, and no headphone jack or IR blaster. I want to stress that a charger is a necessity for using your new phone, for companies as large as Google, Samsung and Apple to not include any is just irritating. Also MicroSD card expansion used to be on every single Galaxy phone except the Galaxy S6, Note 5, and S21 and now S22s. Also the lack of a headphone jack means you can't run the phone to an amp or use your audiophile headphones. The lack of an IR blaster is just puzzling. As the prices of TVs are beginning to drop it would have been nice to have as a feature (especially on a phone that calls itself Ultra).\\n\\nAs for the positives. The phone is well built, has tons of software features, a best in class camera and a great trade in value. The S22 Ultra has incredibly tight tolerances and clicky buttons, as well as a great design. The software features are plentiful, and Android 12 comes with a lot of customization. The camera is amazing, and even if you may not use all the features, it holds its own and will deliver stunning photos and videos every single time. The S-pen is back! And better than ever, with a latency that is a mere 2.8 milliseconds, it's as close to 1 to 1 pen on paper as you'll get. Finally, Samsung promises 4 years of major OS updates and 5 years worth of security patches. In addition, if the price of this phone is too much to swallow, you can trade in your current device and get a good discount.\",\n",

       " \"Paid Best Buy $177.xx out the door for S22 Ultra 256Gb (unlocked) with S21 Ultra trade-in last week. Here's what I've noticed:\\n\\n1) CAMERA: Pictures are noticeably brighter and sharper on the S22U using the rear cameras. Colors are as good as the S21U. Front camera not tested.\\n\\n2) BATTERY: The S22U has similar or slightly shorter battery life than S21U, and the S21U was 1.5 years old! Not a heavy user, but battery seems to drain faster than the S21U. So not an improvement coming from a brand new phone. Not terrible though.\\n\\n3) SPEED: Noticeably faster speed moving from app to app, page to page and loading anything. Things seem more snappy when maneuvering.\\n\\n4) SCREEN: Given both phones are set at the same brightness, resolution and color space, S22U looks crisper and more vibrant. Finer details and beautiful colors contrasting one another. I don't use screen protector for both S21U and S22U.\\n\\n5) CONNECTIVITY: Wi-Fi 6 and T-Mobile data work as should be. Not much difference between this model and the S21U.\\n\\n6) S-Pen: Finally got a chance to know what an S-Pen feels like and how it works. Nothing to see here.\\n\\n7) AUDIO QUALITY: Use Bluetooth to pair with Galaxy Buds Pro for variety of music genres. Settings set the same exactly on both phones. S22U sounds flat with weaker bass. Weaker bass -- not lack of bass. S21U produced better, wider and stronger bass. Speakers sounded similar watching YouTube or making phone calls. Nothing to criticize.\\n\\nSo far so good for me. Only paid $177.xx for use with T-Mobile network. Worth the money now and hopefully will hold value to reduce cost to upgrade to S23U next year. I got the black version.\",\n",

       " \"It's a great phone, no doubt about it. Possibly the best phone out there for now, at least top 10. The battery life is pretty good. It has a very bright display, you can see it well even with the sun out. I see a lot of reviews that are critical of no headphone jack or SD card slot, and I don't get why everyone cares so much. Those technologies are removed from most flagship devices and I really wouldn't use them even use them if they were included. The cameras are the best I've ever seen on a smartphone, it has 5 cameras. One wide angle, a normal, 3x zoom, and a 10x zoom camera (takes pretty good pictures up to 30x) on the back. They have a pretty good selfy camera on the front, admittedly I don't use the wide angle or the selfie cam much. Unfortunately the fingerprint scanner seems to be kinda shotty, but I haven't used it at all without a screen protector. I have a whitestone dome screen protector and the fingerprint sensor only works and 2/3 the time. Hopefully they can improve that some. Like I said this phone is possibly the best and there's one main reason for that. That reason is the price. It's $1200 and I think quite a few will pay $1300 for the 12 GB RAM. I would recommend this phone for only people who actually are going to take advantage of these features. The cameras are probably my favorite feature and definitely worth it if you have the money.\",\n",

The phone can be charged wirelessly (a dual wireless charger is included when pre ordering). The need to both charge the phone & listen to music via USB-C is niche. The lack of micro SD slot is a money making scheme. Rather than buy a micro SD card and use it till it dies, customers would have to buy a model with larger memory every time. That\\'s disappointing. This is not a deal breaker for me, as I can do with 128GB.\\n\\nWhat I find most annoying is Samsung doesn\\'t make any 5G smartphone with a screen smaller than 6\".

My commute route doesn\\'t have contiguous data reception, which means listening to radio over data is lost randomly. Israel doesn\\'t have mmWave reception, but it would eventually, and I do travel abroad. When buying an expensive flagship model, I think its petty to exclude a cheap feature like an FM radio, or to upgrade my smartphone when mmWave does become available.\\n\\n[IIRC, Samsung has explained the S21 models have the same bands supported, local models have certain bands blocked to comply with local regulation, and firmware upgrades would enable the bands when regulation changes.

Samsung was mocking Apple for removing a 3.5mm headphone jack on their phones in their commercials and then did the same thing. For $1200 I would like to have an option to just plug in my favorite headphones and listen to Hi-Res audio. A lot of people want to charge their phones and use headphones at the same time. Apple did that to sell wireless earbuds and Samsung eventually followed the lead. Where is a MicroSD slot? What if I would like to add storage to a phone that records in 8k and only has 128GB of storage. Selling a phone that records 8k videos with only 128GB of storage that can't be extended for $1200 is not acceptable. The phone uses anywhere between 550 and 600 Mb of storage for 1 minute of 8k video. Roughly half of your 128GB of storage is going to be dedicated to Android and Apps. So you only have around 60GB for all your photos and videos. So in reality you can only record 100min of 8k videos on your phone before you run out of space and only if you don't have any other files saved. Yes the processor is faster and the screen and the camera are a bit better than NOTE 9 but when it comes to useful features SAMSUNG went back. Maybe if more people complain about missing features, and stop buying New Samsung Phones that are supposed to be better, things will change.\",\n",
       " 'Terrible phone',\n",
       " 'Screen is crisp and bright, camera is epic and that 100x zoom is actually better then i expected. Battery life is ok but i wish there was a way to change a few more settings in it like with older galaxies and im not a fan of the in screen fingerprint reader, i preferred the print reader on the back like older galaxies. The included pen is also pretty cool tho ive only used it about twice. Ive also noticed that the initial battery life was kinda poor but after about a week it learns when you use it and starts to learn when to shut most things off tho i do think it could use another 500 to 1000MAh of battery but for this kinda power it lasts a good bit i can generally get a day and a half to 2 days out of one charge.',\n",
       " 'I wanted to update my old Galaxy and was looking at this SAMSUNG Galaxy S22 Ultra phone for awhile but the price was more than I wanted to pay, as soon as I saw the one day deal for $898 with tax I went for it and am glad I did.\\nI was interested specially on the zoom of the lens in photo and video, I found out that in order to get the 100X on video you have to record in SCREEN RECORDER MODE otherwise you only get 20X.',\n",
       " \"Play Video\\n This is a perfect smartphone and anybody knows it. I want to know why people buy a high-tech product and pay a lot of money for a smartphone, they shouldn't give wireless or wired chargers including the phone??!!!\",\n",
       " 'I have Giant hands and this was still too big for me. It completely filled my pocket and I had trouble with apps. I ended up going back to my little S9. The s22 is still a good phone but I regret getting the ultra',\n",
       " 'I like everything',\n",
       " 'Husband loved it',\n",
       " 'I upgraded to this phone from my Note 10, and it\\'s insane how much refinement this phone puts in, but critics are right about one thing, the reinventment is not there. However, the refinement is so strong, I am glad I upgraded, because this phone yields absolutely zero flaws in hardware. I love the battery life, my Note 10 had exceptional battery life that i did not complain about, this beast always suprises me when I glance at the battery guage. I use the 25W charger, and it charges faster than necessary, I keep super and fast chargine off the preserve battery life span. Over all, battery is perfect, and the software on this phone allows you to greatly extend lifespan by limiting charge to 85 percent and reducing power supplied. Is the battery perfect? Yes. The display, it makes me tear up from joy. On max setting, the paper does not lie, it\\'s noticeably smooth like butter, I have put my eyes a mm away from the screen while in focus and could not see a pixel, and you can use this phone in every environment. The display has zero compromises. I hear people complain about the corners being sharp, but this is a note for pete sake, its designed for productivity, not defying 2013 screens. The giant screen acheives perfection, the curved edges are pointless but uncompromising and beautiful, i could not live without them. Camera is something I never have seen before in a smart phone. I owned a dslr, I owned a video camera. This phone is very close to a dslr, and the video stability replicates a professional video cameras laser stability. Simply put, this phone\\'s camera are the best on the market and unnoticeably different in daily application from a dslr, yielding perfection. You really get that dslr 10x zoom. Is a dslr better? Yes obviously, but this is a phone, and for the camera\\'s being in a phone at this quality, this feature is beyond perfect. The video recording is orgasmic, my friend said \"thats like a go pro\" except that I had the phone in my hands, not attached to the roof of my car. Processing? I\\'m not going to get too much into that because I beleived the Note 10 was perfect in processing speed, its just over kill in this phone. One thing I noticed, I had this phone on the same network as a iphone 13 max, and my friend was struggling to stream tik tok while i wasn\\'t, over kill that is noticable compared to rivals. Phone is perfect when it comes to processing games, social media, and over all. Now when it comes to android/software. This part of the phone I have some wishes, but for the most part, these wishes are because of the capitalistic asses at apple. The phone on the productive side of things is perfect. It\\'s got every feature integrated percectly, it links to windows perfectly, and if your an engineer or are in the STEM field, your using windows, or your switching to windows after this review and consulting with some simple facts. Streamless coprdination with windows, yields perfect productivity in this phone along with every feature you can ask for in a smart phone. The downside is the lack of a secured sms line, like apple does. I\\'m forced to nomad to messenger or other apps that allow sending of pictureas because your phone carrier will compress images over text. Apple\\'s secure imessaging puts iphone in the lead when it comes to mms. Entertainment, productivity, this phone has not a single flaw unless your used to something else, im obviously used to the note 10 so I\\'m a little bias. The feel of the phone is premium, but, I\\'m picky, and I noticed that there is a small rattle inside the phone when I shake it. Besides this rattle, the build quality is perfect (ive never seen a phone without this rattle including the iphone 13 pro max) its just me being picky and desiring a phone that just feels like a slab of metal. Speaking of which, this thing basically is, and feels like it. It doesn\\'t bend, its a little heavy, but I like it, it just feels like a slab of aluminum. I like how inside the S-pen slot, metal extends about an inch into the phone, the attention to detail in the design is immacualte. The S-pen is flawless in itself. The phone feels like it has haptic feedback of a ps5 controller, although it obviously doesnt have the dimensions that the ps5 controller has because the s22 is a slab. I bring up the vibration to show i inspected everything and the s22 ultra does not compromise anywhere. I was watching a show and I literally thought I had my headphones on, until I realized the sound was coming out of the speakers.\\nThe two flaws this phone has, is not being a inbreed between apple and android, and leaving the factory line with an unnoticeable but present rattle. If this phone had imesage, apple would be extinct. If imessage had some kind of security scandle that made it immoral to use, this phone would be in every bodies hands that could afford it. There is no doubt this phone is the best in the marker because its just a perfect note 8 that went through 5 years of drastic improvement each year. The 5 cycles the note 8 hit through, yieleded this master peice. This phone is an easy five star. It is scientifically undeniably the best phone on the market for productivity. The only debate comes in weather or not this phone is a good option for a young adult who relies on social interaction to be happy rather than their work. If you don\\'t care about missing out on productivity features that you can live without, and you are barley firtting in with your friends, you might not get to enjoy this flawless tool.',\n",
       " 'Just switched to the S22 Ultra after having the Oneplus 7 Pro. The phone feels sturdy and made with good materials. I still have issues with the fingerprint reader as it takes a few attempts to unlock each time, as opposed to the Oneplus 7 Pro which never had that issue. For a flagship phone I expected a bit more, but happy with it so far.',\n",
