Liked my S9+ better but it lacked some neat features of this S22U. I have a S5 that I use strictly as a car phone that I still like but it just did not have enough memory. If it did I'd still be using it. Also, it seems heavy. Haven't weighed it yet But I will soon just for my own knowledge. A lot to learn about the S-pen. A lot!\",\n",

I have managed to fix the problem but not without great deal of difficulty. And I am not sure if Samsung will make it even harder to disable or remove all of the unwanted apps.

This year I decided to give Samsung another try - big mistake. I bought the s22 ultra, after watching numerous youtubers praising the battery life of the phone. After owning the phone for a month, it is clear to me that the Samsung paid a lot of youtubers to lie about the performance of this phone. The phone looks great (besides the curved screen) and it has an awesome OS, with tons of customizations. But the battery life is really, really bad. The 1st phone`s battery was not lasting more than 4, 5 hours, with light usage. It is true that I was using everything, 120ghz refresh rate, always on display, etc. After a few days, I called Samsung support and while on the phone with them, the battery went from 17% to 4% in 7 minutes. They decided that the phone is defective (without running any tests) and told me to ask Amazon for a replacement. Once I got the replacement, I optimized everything on the phone: 60ghz refresh rate, low brightness, no Bluetooth, no 5G, and pretty much everything else that I could think of, to make sure I'm getting a better battery life. All this increased the battery life, but not enough. I was not using most of the features of the phone and I was still worried that I need to be close to an outlet. The fingerprint reader is just not working properly, it failed to recognize my prints all the time ( I didn't have a screen protector). And the phone is running SUPERHOT!!! On a call-hot, watching a video-hot, charging -burning hot, in my pocket-hot. I decided to send it back and I will never buy a Samsung product again.\\n\\nI bought another Android device from a different manufacturer and what a change... not running hot, a day and a half battery, 25 minutes to charge from 1% to 100%.\",\n",

I bought a Doxlion Case Case with Camera Cover on Amazon which has a clever sliding door that covers the lens when not in use for perfect protection. I'm really enjoying taking pictures again wihout the need to carry a heavy camera and hoping I have it when a photo op arises. Samsung is really producing some winners with this phone plus the flip and fold phones. They've left Apple in the dust with their monotonous selections.\",\n",
       " \"I've had the phone since March. My previous s10+ that I had for 3 years will give me a longer battery life than the s22 ultra. What's really frustrating is once this phone hits 5% battery you only have minutes to place it on a charger or it will die. While on my s10 it seemed like the last 15% the phone would last even longer than normal this one just dies super fast. I have watched and updated different settings to try and improve the battery life but this thing barely makes it through the day with me.\",\n",

Softer, less rich, and staticky when pushed. The Note 20 Ultra (I had access to three of them) speakers are significantly better.\\n\\n2. No SD storage card expansion.\\n\\n3. Credit Card MST capability removed which means I cannot use the phone for credit card scanners which are still very commonly used.\\n\\nThe camera is an improvement for sure - probably the main improvement I liked. But not enough to offsett the losses, especially the speaker which I use very often. The Note 20 Ultra is as capable except for the camera which only goes to 5X instead of 10X.\",\n",

       " 'I\\'ve been a SAMSUNG customer/fan since the Galaxy S III in 2012. I Ordered/Purchased the Galaxy S22 Ultra from Verizon on 3/2/22 with scheduled delivery setup for 4/8/22. Phone arrived and was setup using WiFi/Smart Switch on 3/28/22. I immediately noticed that phone was running \"Mad Hot\" during calls/use/charging (Very sadly reminiscent of the SAMSUNG Galaxy S7 debacle, which I also owned/returned). Next, my new SAMSUNG phone started shutting off and on, at a very rapid rate, by itself. I contacted Verizon, and an exchange was setup, at my local Verizon store. Verizon had endless problems transferring my personal data from the defective S22 Ultra to the new replacement S22 Ultra, due to the defective S22 Ultra constantly shutting down. I ended up successfully doing Smart Switch transfers, at home, using my WiFi. Next, I had to trek to FedEx to return the defective phone. Just after FedExing the defective phone, I attempted to photograph my FedEx receipt, as I needed to get my sales tax on the defective phone refunded....YES, I NOW HAD TO PAY SALES TAX ON TWO PHONES!!! Unfortunately, THE CAMERA on the replacement S22 Ultra phone was inoperable. The Camera App was BLANK!!! I immediately contacted SAMSUNG Customer Service/Tech Support, and a Tech fixed my replacement Galaxy S22\\'s camera function. All in all, not an enjoyable, albeit uber time-consuming break-in period with my new SAMSUNG product. I really looked forward to upgrading from my SAMSUNG Galaxy 9+, but the experience thus far, has been one catastrophe after another. I felt very let-down by SAMSUNG and their product quality control. Now, I only hope that I can update this review with some positive updates.',\n",
       " \"Do not buy Samsung electronic devices, especially from Amazon. Samsung is a dishonest and deceptive company that makes defective phones and does not honor their warranty guarantees.

If I hadn't expected the handful of a phone I may have had other thoughts as to how large it is. I'd say it's exactly as expected though. It is a bit heavy, but the battery is lasting me 2-3 days usually. I'm not watching lengthy movies on it yet so that would probably affect how they last. It's a fast and responsive phone though. It updates quickly over 5G and Apps seem to run quickly. I'm very pleased with it.\",\n",

First phone returned because the phone would no import GPS coordinates into a photo EXIF File. And yes, location was turned on and spent well over an hour with Samsung tech support, took over remote control of the phone and made sure it was set up to receive GPS signals and options were turned On to import information into the EXIF File.\\nThey said it was a software problem and to return. I did ask if this was the same problem noted on the internet with GPS and apps on the Exynos Processor, used outside the USA. They basically said they did not know. Just return and see if another phone will work correctly.\\n\\nSo, talking with Amazon tech support, they agreed to replace the phone and immediately sent me another phone. First phone returned at UPS store drop off.\\n\\nProblem is, the second (replacement) phone is just as defective. So, it was sent back and it will be very hard for me to EVER purchase another Samsung phone. (I have a three-year old Galaxy Tab Tablet and it has been great....).\\n\\nIt is evident from reading articles on the internet, the problem they have with the Exynos processor is also on the Snapdragon processor; however, no one at Samsung admits to it, and even for the known issue on the Exynos, Samsung has NOT issued a date when the software update would be sent out. For that reason, I needed to return, I don't want to wait around hoping a software update will fix the problem and then find out a few months later, I'm out of luck.\\n\\nOne other problem with this phone I did not have with the first was signal dropping during calls. Just on WI-FI calls sitting in my house. But I two drops just talking with Amazon tech support. That is also a somewhat known issue as reported on some android forum websites, and the GPS issue is on the Samsung Help forum and it there are a lot of issues as noted by 15 pages of complaints.\\n\\nAnd to think, I ruled out a Pixel 6 Pro due to the problems they were having.\\n\\nI guess I'll just stick with the Pixel 4XL I purchased two-years ago from Amazon.

I spent the day purposely streaming movies and playing games more than I usually do, to see if there were any issues. I'm just going to say, the image quality is amazing. For the people complaining about the speaker quality. It's more than fine. i listened to Spotify and thought it was fine. It really is a gorgeous display. It feels like a mini television.

It's great for jotting down quick notes, doodling at random, editing screenshots, etc. It even has music controls so that you can take the pen and control your music if you are one to plug your phone into a hi-fi away from your desk and such. If that's not your thing, it's nice to have extra tools sometimes when you need them, even if you don't use them often.

Just a cable with a C port on each end that I can't use yet because all my wall and car chargers have USB ports. Even my cars built in charging ports take USB cables and it's a Subaru Crosstrek bought brand new in 2019. Seems petty on Samsung's part to not include a charger to fit the included cable.

This year I decided to give Samsung another try - big mistake. I bought the s22 ultra, after watching numerous youtubers praising the battery life of the phone. After owning the phone for a month, it is clear to me that the Samsung paid a lot of youtubers to lie about the performance of this phone. The phone looks great (besides the curved screen) and it has an awesome OS, with tons of customizations. But the battery life is really, really bad. The 1st phone`s battery was not lasting more than 4, 5 hours, with light usage. It is true that I was using everything, 120ghz refresh rate, always on display, etc. After a few days, I called Samsung support and while on the phone with them, the battery went from 17% to 4% in 7 minutes. They decided that the phone is defective (without running any tests) and told me to ask Amazon for a replacement. Once I got the replacement, I optimized everything on the phone: 60ghz refresh rate, low brightness, no Bluetooth, no 5G, and pretty much everything else that I could think of, to make sure I'm getting a better battery life. All this increased the battery life, but not enough. I was not using most of the features of the phone and I was still worried that I need to be close to an outlet. The fingerprint reader is just not working properly, it failed to recognize my prints all the time ( I didn't have a screen protector). And the phone is running SUPERHOT!!! On a call-hot, watching a video-hot, charging -burning hot, in my pocket-hot. I decided to send it back and I will never buy a Samsung product again.\\n\\nI bought another Android device from a different manufacturer and what a change... not running hot, a day and a half battery, 25 minutes to charge from 1% to 100%.\",\n",

It is a bit heavy, but the battery is lasting me 2-3 days usually. I'm not watching lengthy movies on it yet so that would probably affect how they last. It's a fast and responsive phone though.

First phone returned because the phone would no import GPS coordinates into a photo EXIF File. And yes, location was turned on and spent well over an hour with Samsung tech support, took over remote control of the phone and made sure it was set up to receive GPS signals and options were turned On to import information into the EXIF File.\\nThey said it was a software problem and to return. I did ask if this was the same problem noted on the internet with GPS and apps on the Exynos Processor, used outside the USA. They basically said they did not know. Just return and see if another phone will work correctly.\\n\\nSo, talking with Amazon tech support, they agreed to replace the phone and immediately sent me another phone. First phone returned at UPS store drop off.\\n\\nProblem is, the second (replacement) phone is just as defective. So, it was sent back and it will be very hard for me to EVER purchase another Samsung phone. (I have a three-year old Galaxy Tab Tablet and it has been great....).\\n\\nIt is evident from reading articles on the internet, the problem they have with the Exynos processor is also on the Snapdragon processor; however, no one at Samsung admits to it, and even for the known issue on the Exynos, Samsung has NOT issued a date when the software update would be sent out. For that reason, I needed to return, I don't want to wait around hoping a software update will fix the problem and then find out a few months later, I'm out of luck.\\n\\nOne other problem with this phone I did not have with the first was signal dropping during calls. Just on WI-FI calls sitting in my house. But I two drops just talking with Amazon tech support. That is also a somewhat known issue as reported on some android forum websites, and the GPS issue is on the Samsung Help forum and it there are a lot of issues as noted by 15 pages of complaints.\\n\\nAnd to think, I ruled out a Pixel 6 Pro due to the problems they were having.\\n\\nI guess I'll just stick with the Pixel 4XL I purchased two-years ago from Amazon. Wanted a new phone, but with Pixel and Samsung both having problems, time to sit back and do some more research.\\n\\nAnd I really liked the S22Ultra, when it worked.\",\n",

Glad I splurged and went with the 256 gb version. During initial set up, the top of the phone got a little warm. It made me curious about gaming and watching videos. I spent the day purposely streaming movies and playing games more than I usually do, to see if there were any issues. I'm just going to say, the image quality is amazing. For the people complaining about the speaker quality. It's more than fine. i listened to Spotify and thought it was fine. It really is a gorgeous display. It feels like a mini television. Highly recommend. If you're wanting a change from the Apple ecosystem, I think you'll find multi-tasking pretty great.
